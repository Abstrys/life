        <h2>The Game of Life</h2>
        <p>The <i>Game of Life</i> is an early example of a cellular automaton: a computer
            simulation of life patterns of societal growth and death. It was devised by John Conway
            in 1970.</p>
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>The game proceeds according to the following set of rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cells are laid out on a square grid in a pattern of the user's choice.</li>
            <li>Cells are considered to have neighbors if any of the cells immediately surrounding
            it are filled with other living cells.</li>
            <li>For every iteration of the simulation:
                <ul>
                    <li>A cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.</li>
                    <li>A cell with two or three live neighbors lives unchanged to the next iteration.</li>
                    <li>A cell with more than three live neighbors dies.</li>
                    <li>An empty space with exactly three neighbors spawns a new living cell.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The simulation continues until there are no living cells, or until the simulation
                has achieved a steady state (no changes between iterations).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A rather complete article detailing the history of <i>Life</i> appears at Wikipedia: <a

                Life</a>.</p>
        <h3>Issues with implementation</h3>
        <h4>Edges</h4>
        <p>A major issue that must be solved when creating a computer simulation of Life is what to
            do with cells on the edges of the grid?</p>
        <p>Cells at the edge have an incomplete set of neighbors&mdash;these must either be
            added to the grid (increasing the grid size), simulated (faked somehow), or ignored
            (breaking the simulation at the edges).</p>
        <h4>Movement</h4>
        <p>Another issue, the solution of which also depends on the edge behavior, is what happens
            when the entire collection of cells grows beyond the constraints of the grid, or moves
            completely off of the grid?</p>
        <p>This includes the issue where two sub-groups of cells move in opposite directions,
            leaving a central clear area, but expanding the edges of the simulation. This could
            quickly become a memory issue if the grid is stored as an array in memory.</p>
        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        <h4>Walls</h4>
        <p>The first, and simplest, solution to these issues is to regard the edges of the grid as
            walls. This breaks the simulation at the edges, but constrains it to the initial grid
            size, removing any other issues with regards to orphaned groups, expanding populations,
            et cetera.</p>
        <h4>Mirrors</h4>
        <p>As a variation of the walls solution, the walls could be made reflective, so that each
            cell sees another cell next to it when it is in a square next to a wall. This is only
            slightly more complex than the walls scheme, and doesn't break the simulation as
            much&mdash;but it does change things a bit.</p>
        <h4>Expanding Grid</h4>
        <p>The grid could also grow (and shrink) according to the needs of the simulation. This
            provides the most complete solution to the issues above, but requires a more complex
            and careful implementation to avoid issues with finite computer memory and processing
            speed.</p>
        <h4>No Grid</h4>
        <p>One interesting way of solving these issues is to do away with the grid scheme, and
            regard each live cell as an independent unit. This could require quite a bit of
            processing time, as each cell will need to be considered independently of the others,
            and a way must be devised of finding which cells are close to each other.</p>
